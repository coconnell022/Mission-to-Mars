# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this challenge was to build an app that scrapes websites for data on the planet Mars using python, HTML pages, flask, beautiful soup, splinter, and monogo. The data being collected consists of the latest news about Mars, current facts, and images, as well as images of its 4 hemispheres. The challenge objective was to add information about Mars' hemispheres by scraping the data from a website, storing it in a Mongo database, using flask to display the results, and alter the design of the web app. 

The two additional Bootstrap 3 components used to style the webpage were changing the "Scrape New Data" button to green and condensing the facts table.
